# First React Native App

## Overview
This is my first app made with React Native. It's a simple game where you can move the player around the screen and try to get as many of the black targets as possible in one minute. The score increments every time a target is hit and it is removed from the screen. I decided to do this game because I wanted to try out the accelerometer sensor, which is not something that I have ever done making web applications. When the game is finished, you will be able to text your score to someone in your contacts. This feature is in progress.

## Getting Started

### npm start
This command starts the metro bundler. From here, you have a couple different choices of where to run the app. The QR code will allow you to open the app using Expo Go. Other choices are to press 'a' to open up an Android virtual machine using Android Studio. Pressing 'i' will open up the app on a virtual machine using Xcode.

### npm run dev
The dev command will create a tunnel that helps connect your Expo Go to the server running the app.

### npm run android
Automatically runs the app on a virtual machine in Android Studio.

### npm run ios
Automatically run the app on a virtual machine in XCode.
